### About

I am an undergraduate at Swarthmore College. I am interested in understanding
how and what neural networks learn. My most recent research focuses on how 
robustness in neural networks can be used to understand what they learn. I am 
actively applying to Ph.D. programs and ML research internships. If you feel 
that I would be a good fit for your program or company, please reach out.
